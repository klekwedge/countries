## Overview

### Brief info

Your challenge is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
